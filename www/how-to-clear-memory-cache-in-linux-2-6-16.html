<h1>How To Clear Memory Cache In Linux (&gt;= 2.6.16)</h1>
<p>Without getting into the politics of why you would want to clear your memory
cache in Linux, here is a very small script I wrote to do just that. It makes
use of a feature that was introduced in kernel 2.6.16, so your kernel version
needs to be &gt;= 2.6.16 in order to use this script. If you're running a kernel
older than that, you have bigger problems to worry about than your memory
cache ;) If you don't know how to determine your kernel version, you're
probably better off not messing with your memory cache.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

###
# This script flushes the file system buffers and clears memory caches.
# 
# From the man page:
#
# /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16)
#
#   Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and
#   inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
#
#   To free pagecache, use echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
#   To free dentries and inodes, use echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
#   To free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

sudo sync &amp;&amp; sudo bash -c 'echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches';
