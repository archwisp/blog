<h1>How to deter authentication denial-of-service attacks</h1>
<p>Some hype has been going around the web lately related to the use of Bcrypt
and how it opens you up to denial-of-service attacks. Now, to the seasoned
developer, this is a completely ridiculous notion. As developers, we think
about how and when resources will be consumed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To be fair, one of the videos I saw was targeting "inexperienced developers"
and didn't offer many solutions to the issue. I wanted to chime in with some
simple measures to implement which will help deter attackers from using your
derivation function against you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for a valid user record before hashing the password</li>
<li>Store the last log-in attempt time-stamp for each user</li>
<li>Store the number of failed log-in attempts for each user</li>
<li>Write the following time delay function into your log-in routine before the password is hashed: <ul>
<li>If failed log-in attempts &gt; 1 </li>
<li>Wait until (failed log-in attempts ^ 2) seconds after the last failed log-in attempt before allowing the password to be hashed again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reset the number of failed log-in attempts after each successful log-in</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Simple.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
