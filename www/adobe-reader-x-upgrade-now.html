<h1>Adobe Reader X - Upgrade Now</h1>
<p>For those of you who aren't aware of what's been going on, Adobe has been
working on a "sand-boxed" version of Reader to help protect the underlying
operating system from whatever flaws it may have. Now, it was just released,
so who knows how effective their sand-boxing attempt will prove to be;
However, it will most definitely be better than what we have now: Reader
vulnerabilities being reported every couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I urge everyone to download and install this update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Here is the download link:<br />
