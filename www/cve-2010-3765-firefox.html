<h1>CVE-2010-3765 (firefox)</h1>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unspecified vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x through 3.5.14 and 3.6.x
through 3.6.11, when JavaScript is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via unknown vectors, as exploited in the wild in October 2010
by the Belmoo malware.</p>

<p>The recent prevalence of this sort of browser bug is really disconcerting. I
didn't realize the severity of the problem until I recently investigated how
one of these exploits work; and let me tell you, it's not pretty. If the
browser is hi-jacked, the web developer has essentially no control over what
is happening after the page is loaded. For instance, you could visit your
bank's website and receive the actual web page served over SSL/TLS with a
valid certificate. Then, the exploit steps in and over-loads (or creates) the
JavaScript form handling function. From that point on, anything you enter in
the form is known to the operator of the exploit.</p>
<p>With AJAX functionality becoming the norm, it's also becoming more difficult
to disable JavaScript in the browser and still enjoy your web browsing
experience. On top of that, who knows whether JavaScript is actually disabled
if the browser has been compromised?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mozilla is not the only one to blame here. Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, Google's Chrome, and Apple's Safari browsers have all had this type
of vulnerability reported within the last few months. The other
vulnerabilities may not have been exploitable by a "remote attacker", but the
exploit I mentioned was very successful as a local exploit. How many of you
are certain you will be protected by a 0-Day exploit which then hi-jacks your
browser? Remember, this is a user-space vulnerability; no root required here.</p>
<p>So this is a revelation for me. I've been a web-developer for 10 years and I
always considered web applications relatively safe and secure when written and
implemented properly. Unfortunately, the old axiom, "Nothing is secure",
remains true. The fact that a web site may be completely free of bugs and
vulnerabilities (however unlikely that may seem) is completely negated by the
fact that a web browser is required to interact with the application. And due
to the nature of the Internet, the browser in use is mostly controlled by the
user. I say mostly because web developers have some remedial tricks for
detecting browsers but they can all be circumvented if the user has the
technical prowess. Also, because they may be using a computer controlled by
their employer where they may or may not have permission to use their browser
of choice.</p>
<p>So ultimately, the security of the data passing between the user and the web
application rests in the hands of the browser developer. We can do everything
possible to "secure" the client machine and the web site, but if the browser
is flawed, all is for naught.</p>
<p>Happy days.</p>
