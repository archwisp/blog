<h1>Go, Sanford!</h1>
<p>It's good to finally see an airport questioning the insanity. I hope this
becomes a trend. Unfortunately, they will still have to follow the TSA
guidelines, but those change all the time and hopefully the private company
will have <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/tsa-has-no-time-train-its-screeners">higher standards of training</a> and accountability for its
employees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The backlash continues over those new TSA screening measures, and now
one Central Florida airport has decided to go with a private security
screening firm.  ...  The TSA points out that even if an airport decides
to use a private firm for security, the screeners still must follow TSA
guidelines. That would include using enhanced pat-downs and the
full-body scanners if they are installed at the airport.</p>
