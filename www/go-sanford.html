<h1>Go, Sanford!</h1>
<p>It's good to finally see an airport questioning the insanity. I hope this
becomes a trend. Unfortunately, they will still have to follow the TSA
guidelines, but those change all the time and hopefully the private company
will have <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-
and-liberty/tsa-has-no-time-train-its-screeners">higher standards of training</a> and accountability for its
employees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The backlash continues over those new TSA screening measures, and now one
Central Florida airport has decided to go with a private security screening
firm.
...
The TSA points out that even if an airport decides to use a private firm for
security, the screeners still must follow TSA guidelines. That would include
using enhanced pat-downs and the full-body scanners if they are installed at
the airport.</p>
