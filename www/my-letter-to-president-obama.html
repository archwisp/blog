<h1>My Letter To President Obama</h1>
<p>President Obama,</p>
<p>I know that you have heard the aguments for Patriot Act reform time-and-time
again. So there is little point in my going on at length other than to add my
voice to the chorus, in the hope that you might recognize that The People are
being misrepresented on this front.</p>
<p>Stop this nonsense of spying on American citzens under the guise of
terrorism prevention. Our right to privacy is being trampled as if the
Bill of Rights had never been written. The blance of power between The
Government and The People  is leaning too heavily in the Government's
favor.</p>
<p>We have seen the proof of government agencies exploiting their powers, and
yet, the government moves to grant them more power? You and I know well
that very few agents of the government are ethically pure. How long will
it be before the  increased powers and reduced transparency are exploited
for financial gain?</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Bryan C. Geraghty</p>
