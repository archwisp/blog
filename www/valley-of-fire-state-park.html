<h1>Valley Of Fire State Park</h1>
<p>After talking with some friends at work and seeing some brochures, my wife and
I decided that it was finally time to head out to the Valley Of Fire National
Park which is only about an hour from our house. I have to say that the
driving experience is incredible. I'm an auto racing enthusiast and my wife
would probably attest that I drive in quite a "spirited" manner. For people
like me, this place is a dream come true. On top of the great driving
experience, the view is outstanding. I would often crest a hill and my wife
and I would say, "Wow...", in unison. Then I'd quickly spot a place to pull
over and we'd get out and snap some photos.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with some of the photos that I got but I have to say that
they don't give the place any justice. The thing I noticed right away was that
the scenic pull-offs were always just far enough down the hill from a
fantastic view that the most I could achieve was a decent shot. You could
attribute this to my lack of skill or nice equipment, but I found myself
wishing I had my camera mouted to the car so I could snap photos from the
road. Maybe that's something to persue... :)</p>
<p>It was a fun trip but a word to the wise: If you or a passenger is prone to
motion sickness, make sure they take some Dramamine ;)</p>
