<h1>Yamaha NS-4 Speakers</h1>
<p>A couple of years ago when I was visiting my dad, he was setting up for us
to do some guitar jamming when I saw a distinctive logo on a couple of
speakers collecting dust. As I looked closer, the label read "Yamaha NS-4"
and the model number imediately brought to mind the iconic NS-10M. I
turned to my dad and asked if he knew much about them but he said he
didn't. He said someone had given them to him a few years prior and that
they hadn't even been plugged in for a while. I mentioned that these could
be some significant speakers to which he replied, "I'll mail them to you
if you want them". A few months later, true to his word, the NS-4s showed
up on my doorstep.</p>

<p>Since receiving them, the NS-4s gained a permanent place on my mixing
desk. I knew that they wouldn't be true reference monitors, but to be
honest, these speakers are amazing. Paired with my NS-10Ms, they make a
great a/b team.</p>
<h3>Related to the NS-10M?</h3>
<p>Earlier this month, I decided to try and find out if there was any
significance between the NS model numbers. Now, anyone who knows the
recording industry has heard of the NS-10M. If you look through a
recording magazine, you're bound to find at least one photo of a studio
with a pair of the iconic, white-woofered, NS-10Ms sitting on the the
console. Why they're so popular is a subject of much debate. Some
engineers will say that they are really unforgiving and will only sound
good if the mix is good. Others will say that it's merely the result of
some great engineer mentioning that they used them and it caught on. I
won't go into that argument here; Suffice it to say, they've been used to
mix thousands of great records.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems as though there may be some relationship between the NS-4 and the NS-10M afterall.</p>
<p>I found this post on the following: <a href="http://bryan.ravensight.org/wp-content/photos/2009/03-04%20-%20New%20Desk/IMG_6355.jpg">http://thewombforums.com/showthread.php?t=3835&amp;page=3</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bob Clearmountain and a bunch of us LOVED the mixes we got using Yamaha
NS-4s.  Lots of studios had them on hand because for a few years during
the '80s they were the biggest selling speaker having dethroned the JBL
L-100. They had dethroned the Advents and before them the KLH6s.
Unfortunately Yamaha discontinued the NS-4 and the amount of
professional use quickly depleted Yamaha's stock of original replacement
drivers. They came up with a substitute but it wasn't the same at all
translation-wise. The closest thing Yamaha made to the NS-4 was the
NS-10 which was a smaller "high end" version. When the Power Station
finally ran out of NS-4 drivers, they put in NS-10s. Clearmountain
thought they were brighter but sort of the same so he put tissue over
the tweeters.  He got a write-up about a Stones album he mixed that
included mention of the NS-10s with tissue over the tweeters. Next thing
we knew, virtually every studio in the world had NS-10s with tissue over
the tweeters sitting on their consoles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure how much truth there is to that post but according to Bob's
website, he's been recording since 1965 and I'm inclined to believe him.</p>
<p>Well, whether the NS-4s played a signifigant role in recording history or
not, I sure do love them. If anyone has any more information about these
speakers, I'd love to hear it!</p>
