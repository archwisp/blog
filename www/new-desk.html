<h1>A New Desk</h1>
<p>One of the afformentioned projects that I finished up recently is a new desk.
I took woodshop classes in High School and I've always loved building things
but I've never really had the opportunity to build anything substatial. I've
built a TV riser and a few odd things around the house but nothing that would
get your attention. After a few hours with some graphing paper, I had my
optimal design.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the selection of local lumber in Las Vegas is a bit slim so my
design was limited by the selection available. I already knew I wanted 100%
hardwood, so I looked at what they had at the local Home Deopt, made some
quick calculations in my head, and asked them to cut me a few pieces of Red
Oak and Maple.</p>
<p>About 2 hours of measuring and cutting, 6 hours of sanding, and a few hours
waiting for glue to set, I had my finished product.</p>
