<h1>Finally, A Decent XPS M1730 Bag!</h1>
<p>For Christmas this year, I received a Dell XPS M1730 Laptop to help facilitate
my home studio recordings. This laptop will happily handle anything you can
throw at it but it has one undesirable trait: its size. What Dell fails to
advertise is the fact that this is largest 17" laptop on the market and it
won't fit into most 17 inch laptop bags because its dimensions are 16"x12"x2".
It's a monster when you compare it to a 17-inch MacBook Pro at 15.4"x10.4"x1".
Dell does offer a very nice back-pack case designed specifically for this
laptop. The problem with it is the fact that it was specifically designed for
this laptop. There is not much room left for anything else and the bag itself
is huge which makes for quite cumbersome travel.</p>
<p>The real problem I have, is that I take my SLR camera and some extra lenses
with me everywhere I go. Anytime I travel, I also take my laptop. So far, this
has meant carrying either more bags than I'd like, or over-stuffing one. As we
all know, over-stuffing isn't a great option for delicate equipment.</p>
<h3>Dell XPS M1730, meet the Tenba Shootout Photo/Laptop Courier bag</h3>
<p>The internal dimensions of this bag are a perfect fit at 16.5"x12"x7". The
icing on the cake is that Tenba is a renowned manufacturer of camera cases and
they seemingly had my struggle in mind when they made this one. So far, I have
loaded my laptop, the power supply, mouse, memory card reader, and my SLR in
the bag. Everything is neatly divided and there is still tons of space; but
most importantly, everything is well-protected.</p>
<p>Well done, Tenba.</p>
