# About
## Hello, my name is Bryan

![Bryan C. Geraghty](http://bryan.ravensight.org/wp-content/uploads/profile.jpg)

My hope for this site is that my thoughts and experiences find their way to
those who can make use of them.

I've been a professional software developer and amateur photographer since
1999. I have also been an amateur musician for nearly 20 years. I have done my
fair-share of paying gigs and teaching but nowadays, I spend most of my music-
related time in my home studio. I'm also a husband, dad, runner, home
mechanic, and auto racing enthusiast.

Enjoy!
