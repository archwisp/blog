# Bird On A Post

Okay, it's time. I've been putting off posting photos for so long because I
keep going off on tangents with my photo gallery functionality. I follow a few
photographers who publish one or two photos in a dedicated [essay custom
writing](http://fastessays.co.uk/custom_essay) post and I've decided that I
like that format. It means that instead of making users wade through my entire
collection, I have to chose my favorite(s) and post them individually. So here
goes.

This photo is of a bird who posed for me at the Brevard Zoo in Melbourne,
Florida, while I was there visiting family in the area.
