# Go, Sanford!

It's good to finally see an airport questioning the insanity. I hope this
becomes a trend. Unfortunately, they will still have to follow the TSA
guidelines, but those change all the time and hopefully the private company
will have [higher standards of training](http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/tsa-has-no-time-train-its-screeners) and accountability for its
employees.
