# Go, Sanford!
It's good to finally see an airport questioning the insanity. I hope this
becomes a trend. Unfortunately, they will still have to follow the TSA
guidelines, but those change all the time and hopefully the private company
will have [higher standards of training](http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-
and-liberty/tsa-has-no-time-train-its-screeners) and accountability for its
employees.

> The backlash continues over those new TSA screening measures, and now one
Central Florida airport has decided to go with a private security screening
firm.
> ...
> The TSA points out that even if an airport decides to use a private firm for
security, the screeners still must follow TSA guidelines. That would include
using enhanced pat-downs and the full-body scanners if they are installed at
the airport.
